# WHO IS CHUCK EALEY?

**Charles "Chuck" Ealey** (born January 6, 1950, Portsmouth, Ohio) is the greatest undefeated quarterback in football history.

- **35-0** as starting quarterback at the University of Toledo (1969–1971)
- **53-0** combined record as a starter (high school + college)
- **First Black quarterback to win the Grey Cup** (1972, Hamilton Tiger-Cats)
- **College Football Hall of Fame** inductee (Class of 2022)
- **National High School Football Hall of Fame** inductee
- Founder of the **Chuck Ealey Foundation** and the **Undefeated Spirit** movement

No quarterback in the history of college football has matched his 35-0 record. He never lost a game he started — then was passed over by all 26 NFL teams in the 1972 draft because he refused to play anything other than quarterback at a time when Black quarterbacks were not welcome in the NFL.

He went to the CFL, won the Grey Cup as a rookie, won MVP, and proved every doubter wrong.
